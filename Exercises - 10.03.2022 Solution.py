#> Arrays: Two Sum

'''
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6

Constraints:
```
2 <= nums.length <= 104

Return the head of the flattened list. The nodes in the list must have all of their

How the multilevel linked list is represented in test cases:

We use the multilevel linked list from Example 1 above:

         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL
The serialization of each level is as follows:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]
To serialize all levels together, we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:

[1,    2,    3, 4, 5, 6, null]

#> Graphs: Course Scheduler (Medium)
"""
https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. 
You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must
take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

**Example 2:**

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
 
**Constraints:**
```
1 <= numCourses <= 105
0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
prerequisites[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.

#> Graphs: Network Time Delay (Medium)
"""
https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/

You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. 
You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges `times[i]` = `(ui, vi, wi)`,
where `ui` is the source node, `vi` is the target node, and `wi` is the time it takes for a signal
to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node `k`. Return the time it takes for all the `n` nodes
to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.

#> Dynamic Programming: Minimum Cost of Climbing Stairs (Easy)
"""
https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/

You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase. 
Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

**Example 1:**
Input: cost = [10,15,20]
Output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.

**Example 2:**
Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.

#> Dynamic Programming: Knight Probability in Chessboard (Medium)
"""
https://leetcode.com/problems/knight-probability-in-chessboard/

On an n x n chessboard, a knight starts at the cell (row, column) and attempts to make exactly k moves.
The rows and columns are 0-indexed, so the top-left cell is (0, 0), and the bottom-right cell is (n - 1, n - 1).

A chess knight has eight possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. 
Each move is two cells in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction.

Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly at random
(even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there.

The knight continues moving until it has made exactly k moves or has moved off the chessboard.

Return the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped moving.

**Example 1:**
Input: n = 3, k = 2, row = 0, column = 0
Output: 0.06250
Explanation: There are two moves (to (1,2), (2,1)) that will keep the knight on the board.
From each of those positions, there are also two moves that will keep the knight on the board.
The total probability the knight stays on the board is 0.0625.

**Example 2:**
Input: n = 1, k = 0, row = 0, column = 0
Output: 1.00000
 
**Constraints**
1 <= n <= 25
0 <= k <= 100
