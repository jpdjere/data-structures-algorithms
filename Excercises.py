## Excercise: Two Sum

'''
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
``` 

Constraints:
```
2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
```

## Excercise: Longest Palindromic Substring

'''
Given a string `s`, find the longest palindromic substring in `s`.

You **may** assume that the maximum length of `s` is 1000.

Example 1:

```
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Excercise: Maximum Subarray

'''
Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104

## Excercise: Move Zeroes

'''
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
 ```

Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
```

### Excercise: Rotate Array (Medium)

'''
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

Explanation: 

rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
 

Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 105
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
0 <= k <= 105
```

## Excercise: Container with Most Water

'''
You are given an array of positive integers where each integer represents the height of a vertical line on a chart. Find two lines which together with the x-axis formas a container that would hold the greatest amount of water. Return the area of water it would hold.

![](2021-11-23-08-24-15.png)

As you can see from the graph, we would need to return the are of the container held between the lines with height 8 and 9 (but only using height 8).

height = 8
width = 3

area = height x width = 8 x 3 = 24

## Trapping Rainwater

'''
Given an array of integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, return how much rainwater can be trapped.

[0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2] -> 8

[] -> 0

[3] -> 0

## Hashtables: First Recurring Character

array = [2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 2, 4];

Find the first recurring character. The above array should return 2.

# Linked Lists: Merge Multi-Level Doubly-Linked List
"""
You are given a doubly linked list, which contains nodes that have a next pointer,
a previous pointer, and an additional child pointer.
This child pointer may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list,
also containing these special nodes. These child lists may have one or more
children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure
as shown in the example below.

Given the head of the first level of the list, flatten the list so that all
the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. Let curr be a
node with a child list. The nodes in the child list should appear after curr and
before curr.next in the flattened list.

Return the head of the flattened list. The nodes in the list must have all of their
child pointers set to null.
"""

"""
How the multilevel linked list is represented in test cases:

We use the multilevel linked list from Example 1 above:

 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL
The serialization of each level is as follows:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]
To serialize all levels together, we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:

[1,    2,    3, 4, 5, 6, null]
             |
[null, null, 7,    8, 9, 10, null]
                   |
[            null, 11, 12, null]
Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]

# Linked List Cycle Detection

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
